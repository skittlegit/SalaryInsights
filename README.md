# AttritionAndSalaryInsight

A robust, multi-step machine learning pipeline designed to analyze employee attrition and predict future salaries. Built using classification and regression models, this project aims to assist HR departments in decision-making by quantifying the expected financial loss due to employee turnover.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project combines two key components:

1. **Classification** â€“ Predicts the probability of an employee leaving the organization.
2. **Regression** â€“ Predicts the future salary of employees who are likely to stay.
3. **Expected Financial Loss** â€“ Calculates the loss due to attrition using the formula:

Expected Loss = P(Attrition) Ã— Predicted Future Salary

## ðŸ“š Dataset

This project uses the [IBM HR Analytics Attrition & Performance dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) available on Kaggle.
